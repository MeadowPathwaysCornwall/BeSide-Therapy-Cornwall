    <h2>Hi, I’m Michelle</h2>
    <p>
        I’ve been a qualified counsellor for over ten years and a Play Therapist since 2019.
        My career has been shaped by more than two decades working within specialist SEN provisions,
        where I’ve supported children and young people with a wide range of emotional, developmental,
        and sensory needs. Alongside this, I have supported staff teams with the emotional impact of
        such a demanding and often deeply affecting role, helping them reflect, regulate, and stay
        grounded in their work.
    </p>

    <p>
        As part of my counselling training, I completed my clinical hours with Mind and Penhaligon’s Friends,
        gaining experience with adults, children, and families navigating a wide range of emotional challenges,
        grief, and life transitions.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m Cornish, and I feel incredibly fortunate to live and work in a place where nature is always close by.
        Some of the most powerful sessions happen when I can walk alongside someone — literally and emotionally —
        creating space for connection, grounding, and honest reflection.
    </p>
