    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <h2>Here to Help</h2>
    <p>
        It’s completely natural to have questions before beginning therapy.  
        Below you’ll find gentle, honest answers to some of the things people often wonder about.  
        If your question isn’t listed here, you’re always welcome to get in touch.
    </p>

    <!-- FAQ ITEMS -->
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 Will I have to talk about my past?</h2>
        <p>Only if and when you feel ready. Exploring your past can sometimes help make sense of how you’re feeling now, but we always work at your pace. There is no pressure to go deeper than feels safe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 Can people become dependent on therapy?</h2>
        <p>It’s natural to build a connection with your therapist — the relationship itself is part of the healing. If strong attachment feelings arise, we explore them gently and openly, and we plan endings with care so you feel supported throughout.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 Will therapy help me?</h2>
        <p>Many people find counselling or play therapy helpful at different points in their lives. There’s no instant fix, but with commitment and a supportive therapeutic relationship, people often discover new clarity, resilience, and peace of mind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 Is counselling confidential?</h2>
        <p>Yes. I follow the ethical guidelines of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). There are a few legal and safeguarding exceptions, and I explain these clearly before we begin.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 How does counselling or play therapy help?</h2>
        <p>Therapy offers space to pause, reflect, and explore what’s happening beneath the surface. By understanding your thoughts, feelings, and patterns, you can begin to make sense of your experiences and move towards greater freedom and wellbeing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 Who do you work with?</h2>
        <p>I work one‑to‑one with children, young people, and adults. I don’t offer couples counselling, but I can signpost to appropriate services if needed. I’m not a crisis service — if you feel at immediate risk, please contact your GP or emergency support services.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 I’m nervous about my first session — is that normal?</h2>
        <p>Completely. Our first session is simply a gentle conversation where we get to know each other and explore what you need. There’s nothing you need to bring or prepare.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 How long will therapy take?</h2>
        <p>Everyone’s journey is different. The length of therapy depends on your goals, what you want to explore, and what feels manageable. We review our work regularly so you always feel the sessions are meaningful and supportive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 How often should I attend sessions?</h2>
        <p>Weekly sessions tend to support the best flow and continuity, but some people prefer fortnightly. We can discuss what feels right for you and adjust as needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 Is my problem too small for therapy?</h2>
        <p>Not at all. Therapy isn’t only for deep or long‑standing issues. If something is affecting you — even if you can’t quite name it — it’s worth exploring.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 Is needing counselling a sign of weakness?</h2>
        <p>No. Reaching out for support takes courage. Many therapists — including me — have had therapy too. It’s a sign of strength, not weakness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>🌿 What if I need to cancel a session?</h2>
        <p>I ask for 24 hours’ notice for cancellations. Sessions cancelled with less than 24 hours’ notice may still be charged.</p>
    </div>
